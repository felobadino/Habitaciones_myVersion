# Roommates - Streamlit Project

This application allows you to choose a set of roommates to live in the same apartment, taking into account their compatibility.

-----

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the application up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

-----

### üìã Prerequisites

You will need **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

-----

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get your application running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/felobadino/Habitaciones_myVersion.git
    cd Habitaciones_myVersion
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    It's good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

      * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Once the virtual environment is activated, install all necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or 

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-----

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

With the dependencies installed and the virtual environment activated, you can start the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
